# Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning

## Q-Learning

Q-Learning is a form of model-free reinforcement learning. It can also can be viewed as a method of asynchronous dynamic programming. 



## Asynchronous Dynamic Programming

A major drawback to the DP methods is that they involve operations over the entire set of the MDP, that is, they require sweeps of the state set. If the state set is very large, then even a single sweep can be prohibitively expensive. For example, the game of backgammon has over $10^20$ states.
